Restaurant Management System

The Restaurant Management System is a full-stack application designed to streamline the day-to-day operations of a restaurant. It combines a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express, and Microsoft SQL Server with a user-friendly frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows restaurant staff to efficiently manage customers, reservations, and orders, while keeping all records securely stored in a centralized database. With a clean project structure and environment-based configuration, it provides an organized and scalable foundation for restaurant operations. This system can serve as a starting point for more advanced applications, such as integrating payment processing, role-based access, and analytics dashboards for business insights.
